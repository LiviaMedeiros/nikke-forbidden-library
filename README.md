# Nikke Multilingual Text Archive

This repository coontains texts from *Goddess of Victory: Nikke*, grouped by language (EN/KO/JA). Its purpose is to make it easy to look up terms, names, or lines across different translations — especially where they may vary or lose nuance.

Want to know how incoonsistently Dorothy's アングレイトフル・オズ's signature 『푸슝-』 was dubbed in English and Japanese translations, or how many beautiful epithets English Cinderella used in place of 「美しい」&「아름」? Just grep the coontents.

## Code

The coode is written in Yunicode. It's dumb, but it works. Somehow.

Coontributions to support more types of data are welcome — assuming the coontributor already understands the data structure and workflow. There will be no coonsultations on how or why it operates. I don't remember.

## Disclaimers

- This repository **does not** and **will not** include any datamined coontent from the game files.
- All data is sourced solely from **publicly available coontent** on [**Shiftypad**](https://www.blablalink.com/shiftyspad).
